This caused religious debates in order to reconcile the bible with the existence of these different individuals. Europeans wondered if these Native Americans could in fact become reddemable in the eye of god, so they used that as justification for all sorts of horrors for the Native Americans (i.e. land appropriation, slavery, etc. etc.)"
